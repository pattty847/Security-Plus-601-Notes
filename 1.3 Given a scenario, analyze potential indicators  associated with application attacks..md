# Application Attacks
Application attacks are security threats that target software applications to exploit vulnerabilities. Here are the subtopics and objectives:

## Privilege escalation
- **Objective:** Gain unauthorized access to higher-level privileges within an application or system.
- **Indicators:** Unusual account activity, unauthorized access logs, elevated user privileges, privilege escalation attempts in logs.

## Cross-site scripting (XSS)
- **Objective:** Inject malicious scripts into web applications that are executed in the user's browser.
- **Indicators:** Suspicious input in web forms, unusual script code in web pages, reports of strange website behavior.

## Injections
### Structured Query Language (SQL)
- **Objective:** Inject malicious SQL queries to manipulate or extract data from a database.
- **Indicators:** Unexpected database behavior, SQL error messages in logs, excessive database query activity.

### Dynamic-link library (DLL)
- **Objective:** Inject malicious DLL files into processes to execute unauthorized code.
- **Indicators:** Unexpected DLL loads, abnormal system resource utilization, suspicious DLLs in system folders.

### Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)
- **Objective:** Manipulate LDAP queries to gain unauthorized access to directories.
- **Indicators:** Unusual LDAP query patterns, LDAP authentication failures, directory access anomalies.

### Extensible Markup Language (XML)
- **Objective:** Exploit XML parsing vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access or disrupt services.
- **Indicators:** XML parsing errors, unexpected behavior with XML input, application crashes.

## Pointer/Object Dereference
- **Objective:** Manipulate memory pointers or objects to access or modify unauthorized data.
- **Indicators:** Memory access violations, application crashes, buffer overflow attempts.

## Directory Traversal
- **Objective:** Navigate through file directories to access unauthorized files or data.
- **Indicators:** Suspicious file access patterns, unauthorized access to sensitive files, file permission violations.

## Buffer Overflow
- **Objective:** Overwrite buffers in an application's memory to execute malicious code.
- **Indicators:** Unexpected crashes, memory access violations, stack or heap overflows.

## Race Conditions
### Time of Check/Time of Use (TOCTOU)
- **Objective:** Exploit timing issues in a multi-threaded environment to gain unauthorized access.
- **Indicators:** Data inconsistency, access conflicts, resource contention, and access timing anomalies.

## Error Handling
- **Objective:** Exploit poor error handling to reveal sensitive information or disrupt services.
- **Indicators:** Unexpected error messages, application crashes, error logs with sensitive information.

## Improper Input Handling
- **Objective:** Manipulate input data to trigger unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.
- **Indicators:** Unexpected application behavior, input validation errors, unhandled input edge cases.

## Replay Attack
### Session Replays
- **Objective:** Intercept and replay valid session data to gain unauthorized access.
- **Indicators:** Duplicate session tokens, unusual session activity, multiple login attempts from different locations.

## Integer Overflow
- **Objective:** Manipulate integer values to cause unintended consequences, such as buffer overflows.
- **Indicators:** Unexpected behavior due to integer calculation errors, application crashes.

## Request Forgeries
### Server-Side
- **Objective:** Forge requests to an application to execute unauthorized actions.
- **Indicators:** Unauthorized actions performed on the server, unusual request patterns, access to restricted resources.

### Cross-Site
- **Objective:** Forge requests from a different site to trick users into executing unauthorized actions.
- **Indicators:** Suspicious URL parameters, unexpected actions initiated by users, unauthorized transactions.

## Application Programming Interface (API) Attacks
- **Objective:** Exploit vulnerabilities in APIs to gain unauthorized access or disrupt services.
- **Indicators:** Unusual API activity, API authentication failures, unauthorized API requests.

## Resource Exhaustion
- **Objective:** Overwhelm an application or system with excessive requests to degrade performance or cause a denial of service.
- **Indicators:** Abnormal resource utilization, performance degradation, denial of service incidents.

## Memory Leak
- **Objective:** Exploit memory allocation issues to cause a gradual depletion of system memory.
- **Indicators:** Increasing memory usage over time, system slowdowns, out-of-memory errors.

## Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) Stripping
- **Objective:** Downgrade secure connections to insecure ones to intercept and manipulate data.
- **Indicators:** Insecure connection warnings, missing SSL indicators, HTTPS downgrade attacks.

## Driver Manipulation
### Shimming
- **Objective:** Modify the behavior of drivers to gain unauthorized access or control.
- **Indicators:** Driver anomalies, unauthorized driver modifications, system instability.

### Refactoring
- **Objective:** Restructure driver code to introduce vulnerabilities or malicious functionality.
- **Indicators:** Driver code changes, unexpected driver behavior, system crashes.

## Pass the Hash
- **Objective:** Use stolen hashed passwords to gain unauthorized access to systems or applications.
- **Indicators:** Unauthorized access using hashed passwords, login anomalies, security event logs with hash-related incidents.
