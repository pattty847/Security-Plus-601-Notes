[[Malware Analysis]] tools and platforms can aid in the discovery of what type of malware you might be infected with.

# Password Attacks

1. Spraying - Taking a known password exfiltrated from someone and using it on various other websites in hopes the victim uses it in many locations.
2. Dictionary - This is a brute force attack that uses a prearranged list of words found in a dictionary and it will continue to guess the password using this list of words. 
3. Brute Force
	1. Offline - This case, the attacker must have the victim's password hash, which allows them to crack it at their own speed without having to evade security measures. Giving them an unlimited amount of brute force attempts.
	2. Online - This case, the attacker will be trying each password on the system they are trying to break into. It's much easier to defend or block against because there can be a limit of how many tries you can enter the wrong password before you're locked out.
4. Rainbow table - This attack uses a table of passwords whose hashes are already known. An administrator could have a unique salt for each password padded on to the end to mitigate an attack like this.
5. Plaintext/unencrypted - This is when a password is sent over the internet in it's plain text form without any encryption or anonymity. 

# Physical Attacks

1. Malicious Universal Serial Bus Cable (USB) - this is a tiny computer that lives inside (hacked USB cables) where the USB, once plugged in, can tell the device it's a keyboard (act as a human interface device (HID)) and can start prompting commands to exfiltrate data. They can contain antennas as well, so the device doesn't need to be found and brought back for analysis. 
2. Malicious flash drive - This is a hacked flash drive that may contain the same modifications the malicious USB has. Older operating systems will sometimes run the files found on the device but modern ones have removed this feature. Although, it could still communicate as a HID device (keyboard), CMD might open and quickly enter commands, and before you know it you are infected. 
3. Skimming - the act of attaching hardware to an ATM or card reader in hopes of exfiltrating the data read on the card when it's being used. The card number, expiration device, card holder's name, etc.. 
4. Card cloning - sometimes the hacker will skim a bunch of data, but they still need the physical card to make transactions with it. So, they will create a duplicate of the card with all the original details extracted from the above method. The caveat is the magnetic stripe can only be copied and used, the chip in the card is unable to be duplicated.


# Adversarial Artificial Intelligence

## 1. Tainted Training Data
Tainted training data refers to the intentional modification or manipulation of the data used to train a Machine Learning (ML) model. The purpose of tainting the training data is often to trick the model into learning incorrect patterns or biases, which can subsequently be exploited by an adversary to mislead the model or compromise its integrity during inference.

- **Impact**: The consequences of tainted training data can be severe, leading to incorrect predictions, biased outcomes, and potential security risks. Th entire model might need to be retrained with a more secure method.
- **Mitigation**: Employing data validation, integrity checks, and securing the sources of training data can help mitigate the risks associated with tainted training data.

## 2. Security of ML Algorithms
Security of ML algorithms involves ensuring that the algorithms used in ML models are robust against various forms of attacks and manipulations. This includes protection against adversarial attacks, model inversion attacks, and ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the model and its algorithms.

- **Adversarial Attacks**: Adversaries can create inputs designed to fool the model into making incorrect predictions or classifications. Defenses include adversarial training and input validation.
- **Model Inversion Attacks**: These attacks aim to reverse engineer ML models to extract sensitive information. Ensuring model confidentiality and deploying differential privacy are key mitigations.
- **Mitigation Strategies**: Regularly updating and patching algorithms, using secure and trusted libraries, and employing robustness testing can further secure ML algorithms from various threats.

# Supply-Chain Attacks

Supply-chain attacks target the entire chain of systems involved in the development, distribution, and deployment of software or hardware products. This chain includes raw materials, suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, customers, and end consumers. An attack at any point in this chain can have cascading effects downstream, affecting numerous systems and users.

## Key Points:
- **Trust Vulnerability**: Organizations inherently trust their suppliers, which can be exploited if a supplier is compromised. A single vulnerability in the chain can lead to widespread impact.
- **Modification of Products**: Attackers can modify hardware, software, or firmware at any stage, introducing malicious code or backdoors.
- **Update Mechanisms**: Compromised update mechanisms can be used to distribute malicious updates to users.
- **Third-Party Components**: Many products use third-party libraries or components, which, if compromised, can affect all products that incorporate them. This is a massive issue for the programmers who may use community maintained libraries to build their software on.

## Types of Supply-Chain Attacks:
1. **Hardware Implanting**: Introducing malicious components or modifications into hardware during manufacturing.
2. **Software Tampering**: Altering the software codebase to introduce vulnerabilities or malicious functionality.
3. **Compromised Updates**: Using legitimate update channels to distribute malware to users.
4. **Vendor Impersonation**: Impersonating legitimate vendors to distribute malicious products or updates.

## Mitigation Strategies:
- **Vendor Risk Management**: Conduct regular security assessments and audits of suppliers and third-party vendors.
- **Integrity Verification**: Implement mechanisms to verify the integrity of hardware and software components, such as digital signatures and checksums.
- **Secure Software Development Practices**: Adopt secure coding practices and perform regular security testing, including dependency scanning and code review.
- **Incident Response Plan**: Develop and maintain a comprehensive incident response plan to quickly detect and respond to any supply-chain incidents.
