24. Principles (reasons for effectiveness)
	1. **Authority**:
	    - People tend to comply with individuals in positions of authority. Attackers may pose as executives, IT administrators, or law enforcement officials to exploit this tendency and obtain sensitive information or coerce actions.
	2. **Intimidation**:
	    - Intimidation involves creating a fear-based response. Attackers might threaten potential victims with negative consequences (e.g., legal actions, account suspension) unless they provide the demanded information or perform specific actions.
	3. **Consensus (or Social Proof)**:
	    - People are often influenced by what others are doing. Attackers might create the illusion that many people are performing a certain action or endorsing a request to trick individuals into compliance.
	4. **Scarcity**:
	    - The principle of scarcity is based on the perception of something being in limited supply, which increases its perceived value. Attackers might claim a limited-time offer or a rare opportunity to create a sense of urgency and prompt action.
	5. **Familiarity**:
	    - People are more likely to comply with requests from individuals they know or situations they are familiar with. Attackers might use known company names, logos, or employee names to build a false sense of familiarity.
	6. **Trust**:
	    - Trust is a strong motivator for compliance. Attackers work to build trust, often over time, with potential victims through various means before exploiting that trust for malicious purposes.
	7. **Urgency**:
	    - Creating a sense of urgency can rush individuals into making decisions without proper thought or verification. Attackers might claim that immediate action is required to prevent negative consequences, to secure a deal, or to fix a problem.
